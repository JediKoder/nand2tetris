## Run the Simulator
Launch the hardware simulator, full nandToTetris zip was uncompressed on desktop:

```
> ~/desktop/nand2tetris/tools/hardwaresimulator.sh

## Tools
- [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) online code editor (See also: [our guide to running NAND2Tetris software remotely](https://github.com/LearnToCodeLA/nand2tetris/wiki/Test-HDL-files-remotely))
- [Logic.ly](http://logic.ly/) for designing and debugging circuits
